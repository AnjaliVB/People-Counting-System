# People-Counting-System
A project developed as a task for recruitment process of a company

This project takes a video as input and counts the number of people entering and exiting a particular premises.
The count is shown on the screen.

This project is developed using **YOLOv8**.
It is basically used to recognize different objects like humans, bags, etc.

A real-life example of these types of systems is recognizing whether the driver is awake or sleeping while driving.
