# People-Counting-System
A project developed as a task for recruitment process of a company


This is a pure python based project
This project takes a video as input and counts the number of people entering and exiting a particular premises.
The count is shown on the screen. It is also logged into the logs.txt file.

This project is developed using **YOLOv8-Real Time Object Detection**.

YOLO is a technology 
It is basically used to recognize different objects like humans, bags, etc.

A real-life example of these types of systems is recognizing whether the driver is awake or sleeping while driving.

To use YOLO, you need to install a library named _Ultralytics,Pandas,cv2,cvzone,numpy_ and ofcourse _python3 or later_.
